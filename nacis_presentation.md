# Direct Interaction: Narrative Web Maps and Explicit Bias

* Joe Blankenship, University of Kentucky
* Rich Donohue, University of Kentucky - New Maps Plus

## Submitted abstract

The form and function of a web map for users is rooted in the intent of the map creator. Minimizing modes of map interaction guides the cartographer to develop code, language, and design elements. This directs interaction, focusing the map creatorâ€™s intent, meaning, and message. Users thereby engage in a dialogue through the map with the creator and the wider audience. Therefore, the dialogue initiates a process of engagement superior to traditional maps that simply foment a statement. We conclude by offering standards for UX/UI design that provide for better legibility, explicit bias, and ethical web map development.
