# Direct Interaction: Narrative Web Maps and Explicit Bias

* Joe Blankenship, University of Kentucky
* Rich Donohue, University of Kentucky - New Maps Plus

## Submitted abstract

The form and function of a web map for users is rooted in the intent of the map creator. Minimizing modes of map interaction guides the cartographer to develop code, language, and design elements. This directs interaction, focusing the map creatorâ€™s intent, meaning, and message. Users thereby engage in a dialogue through the map with the creator and the wider audience. Therefore, the dialogue initiates a process of engagement superior to traditional maps that simply foment a statement. We conclude by offering standards for UX/UI design that provide for better legibility, explicit bias, and ethical web map development. 

## Talk outline/topics

### Intro (2 min)

- introduce self and NMP (part of NMP project)
- point of departure: Kenya map example ... how much is too much interaction?
- Bitcoin map example
- following discussion of usability ... how much interaction is too much? Idea of directed interaction. Def: control of form and function of web map to give user interaction intended by designer ... is transparent and leads to better ethical decisions.

### Form and Function (5 min)

Form and function (drawn from LeFeve, etc) ... bigger ideas of space and place being produced ... applying those to coded spaces in web maps. The effect of the map by the user varies with the interaction afforded.

* Web Maps for Users

Form and function flows from web creator to the web map user, which becomes the UX/UI and guides experience. What effects are being produced through the design of the creator to the user?  ... no black-boxing of the design.

Question: at what point is too much interaction or design obscuring the message?

* Map Creator Intent

Refers to what the user wants the map to do (though may be constrained by limitations of ability and tool). Sure, we can anticipate user needs and try to build that, but responsibility of being ethically transparent falls on creator.

* Effects of Viewing (Rose)

Visual methods by Gillian Rose ... "audiencing" ... once one puts out art or product, audience then has ownership of interpretation, etc. Audience is recycling and reinterpreting message/map use ... but with limited directed action, the message of the creator won't get as lost, but not completely misinterpreted.

Simplified narrative approach provides transparent intent of creator. Directed interaction helps provide a path whereby the user's engagement is more aligned with statement of the "About" and the creator's intention.

### Interaction (2 min)

Because responsibility of constraint and enablements is on the creator, designer needs to understand the following:

* Multiple Platforms
* Multiple Generations
* Multiple Cultures

Once you transform the form and function through a technology, the audience consume/interprets the product through platforms, generations (desktop/tables/mobile), cultures (scales of space and geography for access to technology, localized).

### Language and Design (3 min)

Understanding how our form and function are going to guide interaction, we need a grammar for building these maps.

Because product will be used in different ways, we need to understand how code translates into an ethical language ...

* 1. Code to Language (functionality)
* 2. Design to Language (usability)
* 3. Language to Direction (language of direct interaction)

This process translates into an outcome of how the user will use project/map.

### Directed Interaction (3 min)

We've created a path for the user to personalize and clarify the journey.

* Intent (clear in the problem statement of the map/data ...)
* Meaning (salient through a transparent, clear "About" ... this makes the map ethical, not functional)
* Message (through understanding intent and meaning, we then give the use a message which becomes a narrative ... message is used to create the map vis a vis the user)

### User Engagement (3 min)

Process of user engagement and feedback ... we have unique ability with web maps to understand and control the unknowns of the map, positionality of the user, etc.

If we want the map to become effective ... map then becomes a social product through directed interaction --> audiencing --> development of users. Still within the smaller path there is wiggle room, and unintended consequences will happen, but we've minimized potential criticism and maximized potential for better interaction and narrative. Example of specialized tool ... feedback from that tool will be more valuable.

* Perspective and Position (Meinig)

Landscape of Meinig and work of Rose ... Meinig concerned with viewing of landscape ... had matrix of axis of who is looking at landscape ... it has different meaning in space/place context depending of perspectives of viewer.

* Dialogue via Map
  * With Creator
  * With Audience
* Process of Engagement

Control of biases leads too

### Processes of Directed Interaction (3 min)

Guidelines

* Tranparent Narrative (controls the meaning of the map is in hands of both creator and user)
* Explicit Bias
* Simple, Guided, Legible (UX/UI ... taking narrative, making biases explicit with intent and meaning ... clear starting point with help guide them through journey back to the beginning)
* Ethics of Digital Mapping
  * maintaining explicitness of bias
  * maintaining transparency
  * directed interaction
  * limiting too many paths that won't lead to effective dialogue between creator/map/user ... no concise narrative ... and is sensative to the user's view of the map

Scrolly map is good example for demonstrating map accounting for the guidelines above ..
