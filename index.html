                        <p>My name is Joe Blankenship and I’m a PhD student at the University of Kentucky. Today I will be presenting on the concept of direct interaction in web map development and the implications of using such an approach. This presentation and the content was co-developed by Dr. Rich Donohue who is unfortunately not with us today. At the start of 2018, I began taking classes through the NewMapsPlus graduate program with the goal of improving my languishing JavaScript and web design skills. These courses reignited my passion and appreciation for cartography and spatial visualizations, specifically web maps. However, throughout these courses I started to notice certain limitations in the standard web map medium.</p>

                        <p>One of the initial projects was this map of Kenyan primary school student recidivism in 2014. The map provides several interactions from the hover responses with graphs on the map to the grade slider in the lower left corner of the map canvas. In addition to a title, brief synopsis, and description of the map, links to the data, references, and author were provided to the map reader. However, despite all of this, it is still unclear what I, as the map developer and designer, am trying to say with this map. So I set off to find better ways of presenting not only maps, but their intents, meanings, and messages to the map readers.</p>

                        <p>This initial attempt is something I’m sure many of you are familiar with: the narrative map (not to be confused with “story maps”). This particular map leverages D3 and Leaflet to create a hybrid experience for the map reader. Instead of giving the map reader immediate control over the map data, I give them a controlled path through which they can listen to the narrative I am attempting to create with this map. The title and initial view presents the topics and problems to be addressed with this map: Bitcoin; access; inequality. Then, through the majority of the website, all the map reader can do is scroll: being led through the elements of the map to come in a way that a typical static legend fails to accomplish. The reader is given colors and descriptions that connect the topics and problems to the forthcoming Leaflet map while allowing them to situate their reading within a specified critical avenue. When arriving at the interactive map, the map reader can explore the elements and come to their own conclusions and critiques based on the context the map creator has provided them, producing a much more focused reading of the map. They can then transition to the conclusion of the map creator who they can then contact and extend a critique of the map format, data, or narrative.</p>

                        <p>The following presentation will take us through the discussion of usability and interaction that resulted in the idea of directed interaction. Directed interaction is defined as the control of web map form and function resulting in a user interaction intended by the designer and developed in a way that is transparent and explicitly ethical.</p>

                        In consideration of how and why a map creator can and should control, our initial approach is through the form and function of the map. Drawing on concepts of the production of space and place as argued by Henri Lefebvre (1991) and Doreen Massey (2013), we examine the social aspects of the spaces and places of web maps via their code/spaces (Kitchin & Dodge, 2011) which have the potential to produce varied effects through their readings.

                        This refers to what the creator wants the map to do for the user. The map creator may be constrained by limitations of ability and tooling in the process of producing their map. A creator can also anticipate user needs and build in a manner that accounts for them, but responsibility of being ethically transparent ultimately falls on creator.

                        <p>Maps should be designed in such a way that exposes bias of the map creator in an explicit manner. This involves directed interaction that guides the user towards a dialogue with the map and the map creators, exposing the intent, meaning, and messages of the map.</p>

                        <p>Maps should be designed with simple, guided, legible UX/UI. The effort to produce a web map as a narrative experience rather than a story assists in making biases more explicit with regards to the intent and meaning. A clear starting point with help from the map creator guides them through journey; the narrative that channels the map reader through the intent, meanings, and messages back to the beginning where the theme and problematic of the map are connected (Garrett, 2011).</p>

                    <aside class="notes">
                        <p>Mapping and the production of maps should be undertaken and documented with explicit ethics.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The map creators should maintain explicitness of bias through description within the maps narrative.</li>
                            <li>This documenting of biases should support the effect of transparency with the user.</li>
                            <li>Both bias and transparency are developed and deployed within the language of their specific form and function of directed interaction.</li>
                            <li>
                                The language of narrative and its design must express in what ways the experience was limited.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>The map creator must explain why and how too many paths on the topic and problems the map addresses will not lead to effective dialogue between creator and the map readers/users.</li>
                                    <li>No shortcuts should be taken in the drafting of the narrative. A narrative too concise runs the risk of:

                                            <li>Alienating the map reader</li>

                            <li>These are a few of the guidelines that we have established as a basis for our initial exploration of directed interaction. With this presentation, we have attempted to elaborate on the potentials of directed interaction. As we move from the initial forms and functionality  of web maps, we begin to connect the language of development and design with the resultant user engagement and dialogue with the map readers, resulting in the social product that is the web map. Directed interaction and its processes focused on user engagement instill and ethical mandate to expose biases while maintaining transparency of the map creators intent, meanings, and messages. As technologies progress into newer mediums such as VR and AR, directed interaction will assist map creators in the delivery of web UX/UI that takes into account the effects the modes of interaction on the user.</li>
                            <li>To date, we have found scroll maps with effective narrative practices as outlined above to be good examples for demonstrating the use direct interaction.</li>
